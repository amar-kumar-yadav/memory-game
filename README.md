# Memory Game

## Overview
The Memory Game is a classic card matching game where players flip over cards to find pairs of matching symbols. The game consists of a grid of cards that are initially face down. Players take turns flipping two cards at a time, trying to match pairs. If the cards match, they remain face up; if not, they flip back over after a short delay. The objective is to match all pairs of cards.
